As you see in the plots, log scale and root scale plot both retained the properties of the original graph. Linear scale of plots did not provide a clearly relationship variables whereas log scale and root scale did not loosing the shape of the graph. It is because small changes of the high-order variable may lead to large changes on the graphs plot.But linear plot is difficult to graph such relationship.
