1. Ease to develop (for developers)
    - Python: Easy for poltting with a good python opensource package

    - Matlab: Easy for plotting with little coding work

    - Tableau: Easy for plotting. No code required

    - D3: Maybe the most difficult one to plot with 

2. Ease to maintain the visualization (for developers)
    - Python: Easy to maintain with the good package to work on it

    - Matlab: Another easy one to maintain

    - Tableau: The most easy one to maintain with no coding required. 

    - D3: The diffcult one to main. It required a lot of debugging if something goes wrong. 

3. Usability of visualization developed (for end users)
   Python, Tableau and D3 are almost the same for the endusers.

    - D3: The best one. Very interactive and beautiful

4. Scalability of visualization to "large" datasets
    - Python: Difficult 

    - Matlab: Medium. 

    - Tableau: Easy 

    - D3: Difficult

5. System requirements to run the visualization (e.g., browsers, OS, software licensing)(for end users)
    - Python: Browser 

    - Matlab: Software Licensing.

    - Tableau: Software Licensing

    - D3: Browser
